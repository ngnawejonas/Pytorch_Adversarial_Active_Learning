# Pytorch_Adversarial_Active_Learning
Pytorch version of Adversarial Active Learning by [Julien Choukroun](https://github.com/JulienChoukroun) <br>

The original code is in tensorflow at https://github.com/JulienChoukroun/Adversarial_Active_Learning/tree/master/MyCode

I only converted the parts of the code necessary for my own experiments. Functions not yet converted raise NotImplementedError.

+Bug fixes (will write details laters)
